# Cats-vs-Dogs

This machine learning model can classify between cats and dogs. 
This model uses pre-trained convolution layers InceptionV3 from Tensorflow Keras api. Then, those pre_trained layers are connected to dense neural networks. 
Overall the model's accuracy is above 90%.

USING-
-Just download the catsvsdogs.ipynb notebook and run all the cells and then it will ask for the input images in the end. Just upload images from your devices.
